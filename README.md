For this project, I created two separate folders: 1) Initial, and 2) Fixed

The "Initial" folder contains the initial Audit pdf (and code) before recommended fixes were made to the contract's code. The "Fixed" folder contains the final Audit pdf (and code) after all the recommended fixes were implemented.
